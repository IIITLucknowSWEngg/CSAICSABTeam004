## Responsibilities
The following roles are assigned for the testing process:

- **Test Manager**: Oversee test planning, execution, and coordination.
- **Test Analyst**: Design and execute test cases.
- **Development Team**: Assist with defect resolution.
- **Business Analyst**: Clarify requirements and validate system behavior.
  
## Test Strategy
This section outlines the test levels and types for the Amazon Prime Video Clone:

### Test Levels:
- **Component Testing**: Test individual components (e.g., player, subscription module) to ensure functionality.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the interaction between modules, such as login and subscription, streaming and content recommendations.
- **System Testing**: End-to-end testing of the entire system, validating overall functionality, performance, and security.

### Test Types:
1. **Functional Testing**: Verify the Amazon Prime Video Clone meets its functional requirements.
